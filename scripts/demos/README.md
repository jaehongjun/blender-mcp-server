# Dam-Break Demo

End-to-end validation that the MCP python execution path can build a complete
fluid-through-town scene without manual Blender UI steps (beyond enabling the
add-on).

## What the Demo Builds

| Element | Details |
|---|---|
| Ground plane | 20×20 street surface |
| 3 buildings | Blockout cubes along the street |
| Fluid domain | Mantaflow liquid, 32 resolution divisions |
| Water inflow | Positioned at +X edge, velocity toward −X |
| 4 colliders | Ground + 3 buildings (fluid effectors) |
| 2 debris objects | Active rigid bodies (crate, barrel) |
| Camera | 35 mm lens, dolly keyframes over 120 frames |
| Frame range | 1–120 at 24 fps |
| Render settings | EEVEE, 960×540 preview |

## Two Ways to Run

### Option A — Single script (all-in-one)

Send the monolithic scene script through MCP:

```json
{
  "tool": "blender_python_exec",
  "args": {
    "script_path": "/path/to/scripts/demos/dam_break_scene.py",
    "args": {"resolution": 32, "frame_end": 120}
  }
}
```

Or via the bridge test helper:

```bash
python3 scripts/blender_bridge_request.py python.execute \
  --params '{"script_path":"/path/to/scripts/demos/dam_break_scene.py","args":{"resolution":32}}'
```

### Option B — Step-by-step bridge caller

The `run_dam_break.py` script sends individual MCP commands, mixing inline
code (for geometry) with library scripts (for physics, camera, etc.):

```bash
# Dry run — see what would be sent:
python3 scripts/demos/run_dam_break.py --dry-run

# Run against live Blender:
python3 scripts/demos/run_dam_break.py

# Run with fluid bake and preview render:
python3 scripts/demos/run_dam_break.py --bake --render
```

## After Scene Setup

### Bake the fluid simulation

```json
{
  "tool": "blender_python_exec_async",
  "args": {
    "code": "import bpy\nbpy.ops.fluid.bake_all()\n__result__ = {'baked': True}",
    "timeout_seconds": 1800
  }
}
```

Then poll:

```json
{"tool": "blender_job_status", "args": {"job_id": "<returned job_id>"}}
```

### Render a preview still

```json
{
  "tool": "blender_render_still",
  "args": {"output_path": "/tmp/dam_break_preview.png"}
}
```

## What This Validates

- [x] Inline code creates geometry (ground, buildings, debris)
- [x] Library script `frame_range.py` sets frame range
- [x] Library script `fluid_domain.py` creates Mantaflow domain
- [x] Library script `fluid_inflow.py` creates inflow source
- [x] Library script `effector.py` marks objects as collision effectors
- [x] Library script `rigid_body.py` adds active rigid bodies
- [x] Library script `camera.py` creates and positions camera
- [x] Library script `keyframes.py` inserts dolly animation keyframes
- [x] Library script `collections.py` organizes scene hierarchy
- [x] Render settings are configurable via inline code
- [x] Async job path works for baking
- [x] Job polling and completion work
- [x] Render still produces output

## Gaps & Follow-Up Tickets

Issues discovered while building this demo that should be addressed in future
work:

### GAP-1: No library script for basic geometry creation

**Problem:** The library has scripts for physics, camera, keyframes, etc., but
no script for creating basic mesh primitives (cubes, planes, cylinders). The
demo must use inline code for all geometry creation.

**Impact:** AI clients must generate bpy geometry code from scratch every time,
increasing prompt fragility.

**Recommendation:** Add `scripts/library/create_mesh.py` supporting primitive
types (cube, plane, sphere, cylinder, cone) with name, location, size, and
scale parameters.

### GAP-2: No library script for render settings

**Problem:** There is no library script for configuring render engine, samples,
resolution, color management, or output format. The demo uses inline code.

**Impact:** Render configuration is a common task that would benefit from a
reusable, validated script.

**Recommendation:** Add `scripts/library/render_settings.py` supporting engine
selection, resolution, samples, output format, and color management.

### GAP-3: No fluid bake library script

**Problem:** Triggering `bpy.ops.fluid.bake_all()` requires inline code through
the async path. There is no library wrapper.

**Impact:** Minor — the inline call is simple. But a library script could add
validation (check domain exists, check cache dir).

**Recommendation:** Add `scripts/library/fluid_bake.py` that validates the
domain setup before calling bake.

### GAP-4: No viewport/OpenGL render for quick preview

**Problem:** The existing render tools only support full engine renders (EEVEE
or Cycles). There is no viewport render or OpenGL render option for sub-second
preview captures.

**Impact:** Getting visual feedback during iterative scene building requires a
full render, which is slow even with EEVEE at low resolution.

**Recommendation:** Add a `render.viewport` bridge command using
`bpy.ops.render.opengl()` for instant viewport captures.

### GAP-5: No progress callback for async jobs

**Problem:** The async job system supports polling via `job.status`, but there
is no way for the running script to report intermediate progress (e.g., "baking
frame 45/120").

**Impact:** Long bakes appear as opaque "running" status with no visibility
into progress.

**Recommendation:** Add a `__progress__` callback or namespace variable that
scripts can update, surfaced through `job.status`.
